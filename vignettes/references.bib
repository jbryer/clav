	and unsupervised pattern recognition, to build a complete background for professionals and
	students of engineering. The authors, leading experts in the field of pattern recognition,
	have provided an up-to-date, self-contained volume encapsulating this wide spectrum of
	information. The very latest methods are incorporated in this edition: semi-supervised learning,
	combining clustering algorithms, and relevance feedback.This edition includes many more worked
	examples and diagrams (in two colour) to help give greater understanding of the methods and
	their application. Computer-based problems will be included with MATLAB code. An accompanying
	book contains extra worked examples and MATLAB code of all the examples used in this book.
	Thoroughly developed to include many more worked examples to give greater understanding of this
	mathematically oriented subjectMany more diagrams included--now in two color--to provide greater
	insight through visual presentationAn accompanying manual includes Matlab code of the methods
	and algorithms in the book, together with solved problems and real-life data sets in medical
	imaging, remote sensing and audio recognition. The Manual is available separately or at a
	special packaged price (ISBN: 9780123744869).Latest hot topics included to further the reference
	value of the text including semi-supervised learning, combining clustering algorithms, and

	abstract = {Abstract Cluster analysis refers to a wide range of data analytic techniques for class discovery and is popular in many application fields. To assess the quality of a clustering result, different cluster validation procedures have been proposed in the literature. While there is extensive work on classical validation techniques, such as internal and external validation, less attention has been given to validating and replicating a clustering result using a validation dataset. Such a dataset may be part of the original dataset, which is separated before analysis begins, or it could be an independently collected dataset. We present a systematic, structured review of the existing literature about this topic. For this purpose, we outline a formal framework that covers most existing approaches for validating clustering results on validation data. In particular, we review classical validation techniques such as internal and external validation, stability analysis, and visual validation, and show how they can be interpreted in terms of our framework. We define and formalize different types of validation of clustering results on a validation dataset, and give examples of how clustering studies from the applied literature that used a validation dataset can be seen as instances of our framework.
