Description: Functions to assist with validating cluster analysis,
    particularly for evaluating whether cluster solutions are stable
    across multiple data sets. This can be done using simple random
    samples, bootstrap samples, or across multiple data sets. Additional
    functions and visualizaitons are provided to assist with the
    interpretation of cluster profiles. Multiple clustering algorithms are
    supported included k-means and latent profile analysis.
