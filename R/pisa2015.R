#' Student questionnaire and science performance data from the 2015 PISA
#'
#' This is a subset of the Programme of International Student Assessment (PISA)
#' including student questionnaire data and their performance on the science
#' assessment. Data from the United States and Canada are included.
#'
#' @details
#' There are seven variables:
#'
#' * `country.` The country the student is from (USA or Canada).
#' * `science_score.` Average science score over the 10 plausible values.
#' * `principals.` Average scale score for students self-reported understanding of scientific principals.
#' * `belonging.` Average scale score for belonging.
#' * `interest.` Average scale score for interest in science.
#' * `enjoyment.` Average scale score for enjoyment doing science.
#' * `motivation.` Average scale score for motivation in science.
#' * `efficacy.` Average scale score for students self-efficacy in science.
#'
#' All numeric scores have been converted to standard scores (z-scores).
#'
#' Below are the Likert response questions students completed that are used to
#' calculate the belonging, interest, motivation, efficacy, and principals
#' variables. The values in parentheses correspond to the variable names in the
#' original PISA database. The questionnaire can be downloaded from
#' [the OECD PISA website](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/data/datasets/pisa/pisa-2015-datasets/questionnaires/Student%20questionnaire%20PBA%20main%20PISA%202015.pdf).
